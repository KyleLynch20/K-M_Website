            <h2  style="margin-top: 10px;">Public Safety DAS Wireless Signal Boosters</h2>
            <div>First responders must be able to maintain communications throughout a property in an emergency situation. Whether they are responding to a fire, medical emergency or domestic threat, they cannot be in a situation where their radios stop working. It is essential that their communication devices continue to transmit in hard-to-reach areas, such as stairwells, elevators, basements, and thick-walled or shielded areas.

                This level of in-building coverage for first responders is not an amenity but a requirement. Almost every city and county in the US has enacted local ordinances and codes making in-building coverage for first responders mandatory. These regulations mandate that every building must meet a minimum level of first responder communication reliability as a condition for occupancy. It is the responsibility of the building owner or operator to test their building and, if needed, install a system and make sure it is up to code.
